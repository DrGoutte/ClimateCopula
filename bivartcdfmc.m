% Numerically approximates the double integral
% of a bivariate Student's distribution, with zero
% means and unit variances, correlation rho and degrees of freedom nu
% VIA MONTE CARLO
%
% INPUTS:	b1, an Nx1 vector or a scalar, the upper bounds on the outer integral
%				b2, an Nx1 vector or a scalar, the upper bounds on the inner integral
%				rho, an NxM matrix or a 1xM vector, the correlation coefficients of the joint densities
%				nu,  an NxM matrix or a 1xM vector, the degrees of freedom parameter
%				nobs, a scalar: the number of Monte Carlo samples to draw (actually 4 times this effectively)
%						default is 25,000.
%
% OUTPUTS: out1, a NxM matrix of the cdf's of the joint standard Normal dist'ns 
%								at (b1,b2) with correlation coefficient rho
