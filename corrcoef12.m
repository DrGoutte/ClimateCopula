function xy = corrcoef(x,y)
%CORRCOEF Correlation coefficients.
%   CORRCOEF(X) is a matrix of correlation coefficients formed
%   from array X whose each row is an observation, and each
%   column is a variable.
%   CORRCOEF(X,Y), where X and Y are column vectors is the same as
%   CORRCOEF([X Y]).
%   
%   If C is the covariance matrix, C = COV(X), then CORRCOEF(X) is
%   the matrix whose (i,j)'th element is
%
%          C(i,j)/SQRT(C(i,i)*C(j,j)).
%
%   See also COV, STD.
